# Homework4
This is the first online quiz that I created.

## Instruction
Click start to start the quiz.
There are 10 questions in total related to HTML CSS and Javascript (not so much about CSS).

You have 15 seconds for each question, once you clicked on an answer time will stop for that question. And correct answer will show in a description box. 
Your result will be generated after all 10 questions are completed.
Welcome to redo the quiz after finishing.

To view your record in local storage, please reload/refresh the page, and you will see if at the end of the quiz.

Last but not the least, enjoy!
